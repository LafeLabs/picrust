# Time Bernars Lee, creator of the Web

*Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.*

 - The Web was created by goofing off in a physics lab, doing a side project
 - Employee directory, internal network not public
 - Social
 - The Web can be thought of as one giant document consisting of many linked documents
 - [Hypertext wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) 
 - Technology ***not owned or controlled by anyone***

[Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext): Documents which contain links to other documents. Lee's insight was simple: put hypertext on the Internet.
