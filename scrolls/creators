# creators
 
 - content creators have a relationship with operators, venue owners, and the community which allows them to get direct material support
 - local content for local people can build local value which goes back to support the creators
 - "content creator" can include anyone who creates any kind of media, including promotional media for whatever they happen to be doing. As long as whatever a creator does has value to a local community, our network should be able to facilitate supporting them.
