# Web 2.0
 
Users constantly generate private and personal content, which replaces centrally distributed content as the primary media people consume.  We consume media we all create ourselves.  

 - Started with MySpace and Friendster which were static, were a democratization of the DIY personal home page people made on college campuses with HTML
 - Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest, Snapchat, YouTube, Twitch, etc.
 - Facebook grew almost overnight to take over the Harvard internal network
 - Facebook is effectively the Dark Web: it breaks the open paradigm of the Web, replacing a free and shared public document with a set of private spaces
 - "Sharing economy" extracts value from local transactions all over the world and funnels it all to a few companies who have monopolies 
 - Web3 is just Web 2.0 with different owners, it's still effectively a dark web
